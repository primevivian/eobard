# Eobard Firmware
The keyboard uses KMK firmware as a base. Follow their (Getting Started Guide)[https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/en/Getting_Started.md] to properly setup both sides.

## To Do:
* Setup I2C OLED Screen behaviour.
> I'm not sure using OLED screens on a split keyboard is even possible using kmk with peg_oled, as it stands I will not add this functionality
