## Project Description
Eobard is an ortholinear 34 key split keyboard made for my personal needs. Inspired by the [Ferris](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris).

The columns are spaced out vertically so as to provide the most comfortable typing experience for my hand size. It is designed to be cheap to manufacture and simple to assemble. The single PCB is is dual sided, only having to be flipped around for assembly of the other side.

## Project Requirements
* Use standard size Raspberry Pi Pico [RP2040 Chip].
* Single PCB for both sides.
* THT everything.
* OLED display on both sides.
* Less than 10$ manufacture price on JLCPCB.

## Project Progress
- [x] Design Layout. 
- [x] Design PCB & Plate.
- [x] Build Prototype.
- [ ] Write Full Firmware.
